# Melissa
Melissa recommends a nearby place to eat based on location. There is no backend as this purely utilizes Google Maps API.

Melissa was created to solve a daily problem of figuring out where to go to eat. It may not have addressed the problem fully, but at least it narrows down the options and introduce a lot of undiscovered food places.

# How to use Melissa?
1. Create a Google Maps API key.
2. Replace `YOUR-API-KEY` in script element with your Google Maps API key in index.html.
3. Open index.html with your browser.
